In this repository I archive useful resources about Big Data Algorithm:
Applications such as computational biology
large scale computational model such as streaming algorithm, coresets etc.
and may be topics about frame work and big data enginnering such as what taugh in CS 224 W stanford course.
large scale reliable design and frameworks eg. hadoop

let me say about something else in this new branches
